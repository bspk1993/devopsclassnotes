History of Unix and Linux

Game : Space war game

DOS : single user single processer
windows : single user multi processer

Unix : Ken Thompson Bell Labs in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

Minix : In the early 1980s, Professor Andrew S. Tanenbaum created a small Unix-like operating system called Minix

Linux :  In 1991, a 21-year-old student named Linus Torvalds 

The name Linux is a combination of his first name, Linus, and Unix

Unix is licensed , Linux is FREE

Linux is Open-Source
Linux is Multi-User
Linux is Multi-Tasking

Linux is Portable (Can run in various hardware platforms)


Linux File Hierarchy Structure
============================

Diagram

The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation. 

/(Root)		: Every single file and directory start from the root directory.
/bin   		: Contains binary executables.cat, ls, cp etc are here
/boot 		: Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd. 
/dev 		: Include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
/etc 		: Contains configuration files required by all programs.
/home		: Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
/tmp 		: Temporary files.

printenv  -- it shows JAVA_HOME

export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH    

 [he PATH variable is an environment variable that tells the system where to look for executable files when a user enters a command in the terminal:]

java --version -- now it is java 11


What we did was temporary , if you logout this export variable is gone, to make it permanent ./bashrc

How to add a new Env Variable permanently on Linux?

Be in Home directory : cd

Transfer files


Transfer files between Linux Servers using SCP command
===================================================

SCP - Secure Copy Protocol , is a command line tool used for securely transferring files between local and a remote host or between
2 remote hosts using SSH for Encryption and authentication

Syntax
======
scp /local/file username@remotehost:/path/

scp -i key-pair-name.pem /path/my-file.txt ec2-user@privateip:/path/

Launch another RedHat Linux EC2

create a pem file  vi MyKey.pem
chmod 400 pemfile

scp -i MyKey.pem file1 ec2-user@172.31.19.242:/tmp/

or

scp -i MyKey.pem test.zip ec2-user@172.31.6.82:/home/ec2-user/

scp -r -i MyKey.pem test/ ec2-user@172.31.6.82:/home/ec2-user/  ---> for dir recursive

Login to another EC2 and check the files.


=================================================

Setup Apache WebServer on Linux

====================================================

Launch RedHat Linux EC2 instance


yum install httpd -y

cat /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf   --- all apache configurations will be here (changing port, listen 80 or 8080)

cd /var/www/html/

vi index.html

https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_contact_form.asp 

paste some sample html code

systemctl status httpd
systemctl start httpd


================================================

Launch RedHat Linux EC2 instance

Setup Nginx on Linux as WebServer
----------------------------

What is nginx?

It is a web-server that accepts requests via http/s and respond to display website content through storing, processing, and delivering webpages to users

This can also be used as Reverse Proxy, Load Balancer etc

sudo -s

yum install -y nginx

nginx -version

systemctl status nginx

cat /etc/nginx/nginx.conf  -- contains nginx configurations
cd /usr/share/nginx/html

cat index.html

Put IP in Browser

cd /var/log/nginx/

============================================================

Setup Nginx on Linux as Reverse Proxy
===========================================================

What is a proxy server?
In computer networking, a proxy server is a server application that acts as an intermediary between a client requesting a resource and the server providing that resource.

What is a reverse proxy server?
A proxy service which takes a client request, passes it on to one or more servers.
Proxying is typically used to distribute the load among several servers, 
seamlessly show content from different websites, 
or pass requests for processing to application servers over protocols other than HTTP.

Client ------> Reverse Proxy(EC2 with Nginx) -----> App Server(EC2 with httpd)

Launch RedHat Linux EC2 instance having nginx reverse proxy and another server which has any website (httpd with index.html)

Nginx EC2 instance - use previous machine remove nginx : yum remove nginx

yum install -y nginx

cd /etc/nginx/
vi nginx.conf

 location / {
        proxy_pass http://172.31.23.194:80/;
        }

systemctl restart nginx

Put nginx IP in browser, you get error

check error in logs

cd /var/log/nginx
cat error.logs

Permission denied) while connecting to upstream

Solution
-----
list of all httpd SElinux Boolean
getsebool -a | grep httpd
setsebool httpd_can_network_connect on -P

Put nginx IP in browser it will redirect to App Server



What is Forward Proxy?
-----------------------

A forward proxy, also referred to as a “proxy server,” or simply a “proxy,” is a server that sits in front of one or more client computers and serves as a conduit between the clients and the internet. The forward proxy receives the request before sending it on from the client machine to the internet resource. On behalf of the client machine, the forward proxy then sends the request to the internet and returns the response.

A forwards proxy is mostly used for:

Client Anonymity
Caching
Traffic Control
Logging
Request/Response Transformation
Encryption

 	                        Forward Proxy                           	Reverse Proxy

Purpose 	Provides anonymity and caching to clients 	Improves server performance, load balancing, and security

Location	Between the client and the internet 	        Between the internet and server

Visibility	The client is aware of the proxy 	        The server is not aware of the proxy

Configuration	The client must be configured to use proxy 	Server must be configured to use proxy use

Use cases 	Bypassing content filters, 
                accessing restricted content 	                Load balancing, caching, SSL/TLS offloading, web application firewall
Examples 	Squid, Proxy, Tor 	                        Nginx, Apache, HAProxy



==================================
Granting access to the server without a password.
Launch Amazon Linux 2 -  2 Linux EC2 instances
==========================================

run commands on both Server-1 and Server-2

sudo -i
hostnamectl set-hostname server-1
sudo -i

## first set the password for root
passwd root  

set new password: root123456

## enable all server to login as root

vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config (38 & 61 uncomment both lines) PermitRootLogin yes | PasswordAuthentication yes
systemctl restart sshd
systemctl status sshd
hostname -i -- to see the private ip

On Server -1
==========

cd /

ssh-keygen 

ls -al

ll .ssh

syntax:
ssh-copy-id root@private ip of Server-2 -- > yes -- > password -- > ssh private ip -- > ctrl d


ssh-copy-id root@172.31.17.111


ssh root@172.31.17.111
